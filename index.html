        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This app will help countless numbers of families and individuals who
          need a faster, and more seamless way to connect with providers. They
          need a direct line of communication to give updates, and to prevent
          the expensive shortcomings that stem from inaccurate information. This
          app will allow patients and their providers to have an accurate log of
          medical history, visits, medications, and the expenses that accompany
          those items. By having an accessible record that can easily be updated
          and corrected, passing the right information has never been easier.

        <h2>The Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Anyone can pick up the phone and dial a random provider, but is that
          provider in the right insurance network? Are they available when you
          need them to be? Do these providers have reviews that give social
          proof and confidence that patients are making the right decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting healthcare, let only the right kind of healthcare, is harder
          than ever. In order to empathize with different types of users, we
          created personas to make sure the product is solving actual pain
          points.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          The first solution this app brings is giving patients a direct line to
          provider’s details and availability. Having this readily available,
          there’s no need for phones ringing off the hook or long hold times
          only to find out the wrong number was dialed. A calendar view of
          available time slots allows the user to click the desired slot, which
          then lets them book an appointment instantly. <br /><br />
          The other major frustration this app solves is keeping the patient and
          provider on the same page, through a secure messaging system where
          updates and corrections are delivered swiftly. There are many cases
          where patients forget to give details until they get home, or
          misinformation is passed into a patient’s chart. These inaccuracies
          cause unnecessary visits and wasted payments. By having a way for both
          parties to make corrections, regular tasks become less task consuming.

            The goal of this site map is to serve as simple and intuitive guide
            of the application's content structure. Based on our target audience
            and our content we made educated assumptions on the best way to
            navigate through this app

            journey and site maps.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of the app is to provide a solution to the painful process of
          connecting with the right healthcare providers and preventing the
          mishaps that come with having one. This project was a fun challenge
          that I plan on improving further. The next steps will be to research
          and solve the issues that insurance plays in the process.
